I graduated from the school with title of IT technician.
I’m going to start my studies in computer science.
Programming is my passion and it really brings me joy.
I’m interested in creating responsive websites and making clean and 
reusable code. I’m willing to learn new technologies or frameworks.
I’m looking for my first job as Frontend Developer to be able to 
develop further and gain new experience.
